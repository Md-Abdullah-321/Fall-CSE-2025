# 1st Semester — C Programming

This semester focuses entirely on **C programming fundamentals**, covering core concepts such as control flow, conditions, loops, functions, strings, and basic logic building through problem-solving.

### 🎮 Quiz Game with Leaderboard

A console-based quiz game developed in C that includes:

- Multiple-choice questions
- Score calculation logic
- Leaderboard system to track and display top scores
- Use of conditional statements, loops, arrays, and file handling (where applicable)

This project demonstrates practical application of C programming concepts in a complete, working program.

### 🧩 Basic Programming Problems

A collection of small C programs focused on building strong logical foundations. Examples include:

1. **Check whether a number is even or odd using boolean logic**
2. **Find the largest number among five given numbers**
3. **Count vowels and consonants in a string**
   - Example input: `Alifa`
   - Output:
     - Vowels: 3
     - Consonants: 2

These programs are designed to improve understanding of conditions, loops, strings, and basic algorithmic thinking in C.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

- Understand C syntax and program structure
- Develop logical thinking and problem-solving skills
- Practice working with numbers, strings, and conditions
- Build confidence by creating both small programs and a complete mini-project

## 📝 Notes

- All programs are written in standard C.
- Each program is kept simple and well-focused on a single concept.
- Code is organized for readability and future reference.
